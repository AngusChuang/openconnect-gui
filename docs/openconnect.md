### OpenConnect compilation

The 'openconnect' binary and libraries incl. dependent libraries
used in this project are actually build and packaged
incl. library/header dependencies on Fedora 25
via [this script](../contrib/build_mingw-openconnect-w32@fedora25.sh).

These commands and paths may vary...
